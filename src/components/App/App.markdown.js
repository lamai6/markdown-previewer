export default `# Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!

## This is a sub-heading...

You can also make text **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~ or... ~~**_all of them!_**~~.

Here's some \`inline code\`, and below is multiline code:

\`\`\`js
this.setState(
    (state) => (state.count > 0 && { count: state.count - 1 }) || state
);
\`\`\`

There are also [links](https://github.com/lamai6/markdown-previewer).

> And blockquotes.

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

- I am a list
    - with different indentation levels.

And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:
